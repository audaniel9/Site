                I am a highly motivated and focused software developer experienced in multiple programming languages, technologies, and the field of IT.
                Programming to me is like learning a new language. You have bits and pieces and you're trying to connect them together to form a coherent structure.
                Instead of words, we use logic and our end goal is to solve a problem and take advantage of the full range of the tools you are using.
